# ✅ FIXED: Read the Docs Build Issues Resolved

## 🎯 **Final Solution Summary**

The Read the Docs build was failing due to **16 warnings** about unknown Pygments lexer 'csv'. The simplest and most effective solution was to replace all `csv` code blocks with `text` blocks.

## 🔧 **Root Cause & Fix**

**Problem**: Pygments (syntax highlighter) doesn't recognize 'csv' as a valid lexer name
**Solution**: Changed all `\`\`\`csv` to `\`\`\`text` in markdown files
**Result**: CSV data displays as clean, formatted text (actually better than syntax highlighting for CSV)

## 📝 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Fixed CSV Code Blocks**
```bash
# Command executed:
find . -name "*.md" -type f -exec sed -i 's/```csv/```text/g' {} \;
```

**Files affected:**
- `docs/1_sample_sheets.md` (11 instances)
- `docs/5_reference_genomes.md` (1 instance) 
- `docs/barcode_processing_guide.md` (4 instances)

### 2. **Enhanced Configuration**
- Added `linkify-it-py` to requirements.txt for better MyST functionality
- Maintained `fail_on_warning: true` for strict quality control
- Clean configuration without warning suppression hacks

### 3. **Infrastructure**
- Created `docs/_static/.gitkeep` for missing directory
- Added test scripts for local verification

## ✅ **Verification Results**

**Local Build Test** (same flags as Read the Docs):
```bash
python -m sphinx -T -W --keep-going -b html -d _build/doctrees -D language=en . _build/html
```

**Result**: ✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED** with zero warnings!

## 🚀 **Expected Read the Docs Outcome**

Your next Read the Docs build should:
- ✅ Complete successfully without any warnings
- ✅ Display CSV data as clean, formatted plain text  
- ✅ Show your slide_snake logo
- ✅ Generate HTML, PDF, and EPUB formats
- ✅ Have proper Read the Docs theme and navigation

## 🧪 **Test Locally**

Quick verification:
```bash
./test_docs.sh    # Unix/Linux/macOS
# or
test_docs.bat     # Windows
```

**Status**: 🟢 **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

The build will now succeed on Read the Docs! The CSV syntax highlighting issue is permanently resolved without any workarounds or warning suppressions.
